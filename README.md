## MACHINE LEARNING IN PYTHON - THE COURSERA COURSE I LEARNT
- Hello. This is going to be what I've learnt, mostly lab-related codes, on models of machine learning.
- This is also going to be my first time trying to use Git Hub, so I hope this will be interesting.
- Throughout my published lab coding problems and my comments for those, I will explain them all in this file (Though I think that's the purpose of this README.md file anyway...)
- Let's get to it!
